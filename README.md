# MVVM APP to browse Github repos by user

I have accomplished this app in less than 2 days. I have implemented MVVM architecture and written this app in kotlin. I did not have time to attempt the Senior Android Developer part but I am sure I can do it. There are more things I would implemented but in the interest of time this is the bare bones architecture of how I would go about designing an app.
